This distribution provides an alternative LaTeX package for writing
a UBC-conformant dissertation.  It was created by Brian de Alwis.
This package uses commonly-available packages available in most
LaTeX distributions such as MikTeX and TeXLive.

You should review the various FoGS Thesis Specifications and Formatting
Requirements.  FoGS is very accepting of different fonts, but is
otherwise very strict on the formatting requirements.

I developed this package separately from Michael Forbes's
ubcthesis.cls/genthesis.cls: unlike Forbes' class, this class builds
on top of the standard LaTeX book class and this class has better
compatibility with standard LaTeX packages.
