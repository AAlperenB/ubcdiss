This distribution provides an alternative LaTeX package for writing
a UBC-conformant dissertation (at least as of June 2008).  This
package uses commonly-available packages available in most LaTeX
distributions such as MikTeX and TeXLive.

You should review the various FoGS Thesis Specifications and Formatting
Requirements.  FoGS is very accepting of different fonts, but is
otherwise very strict on the formatting requirements.

I developed this package separately from Michael Forbes's
ubcthesis.cls/genthesis.cls: unlike Forbes' class, this class builds
on top of the standard LaTeX book class and this class has better
compatibility with standard LaTeX packages.

Notes on using XeTeX/XeLaTeX:
=============================

You may need to use a more recent version of XeTeX/XeLaTeX; I used 0.997.
If you're not a somewhat proficient C hacker, then find a capable friend. 
The XeTeX source can be fetched from

    http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/xetex/TRUNK

Run the handy 'build-xetex' script there.  If all goes well, you'll
have new versions of xetex, xdvipdfmx, and xdv2pdf which you'll need
to install in the right place.  Note that you may need to regenerate
your formats for the new xetex binary; the easiest way seems to be:

  $ sudo fmtutil-sys --refresh
