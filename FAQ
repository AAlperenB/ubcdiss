Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Many questions are also answered in doc.pdf.

Q. I get an error in macros.tex that \DeclareUrlCommand can't be found.

A. Your TeX distribution has an old version of url.sty.  Find a more
   recent version, such as:
   
    http://ctan.org/get/macros/latex/contrib/misc/url.sty

   and just copy it to this directory.  TeX/LaTeX first look in the
   current directory for all included files, and then proceed to
   look in the other configured locations.  You can also change the
   standard locations by modifying your TEXINPUTS or texmf.cnf;
   the details are far beyond the scope of this package.


Q. I get a warning from <<<some package>>> that <<<some option>>>
   is obsolete.  Is this ok?

A. Yes.  These options were necessary for my LaTeX installation
   (MacTeX 2007), and I'd rather leave them rather than have a
   student's thesis rejected because they used an older LaTeX.


Q. Can I modify this template for use at a different university?
   Can I distribute the modified template?

A. By all means.  This package has been released to the public domain
   which means that you can do with it what you will!


Notes on using XeTeX/XeLaTeX:
=============================

Many TeX distributions ship with an older version of XeTeX/XeLaTeX,
and you may need to use a more recent version of XeTeX/XeLaTeX; I
used 0.997.  If you're not a somewhat proficient C hacker, then
find a capable friend.  The XeTeX source can be fetched from

    http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/xetex/TRUNK

Run the handy 'build-xetex' script there.  If all goes well, you'll
have new versions of xetex, xdvipdfmx, and xdv2pdf which you'll need
to install in the right place.  Note that you may need to regenerate
your formats for the new xetex binary; the easiest way seems to be:

  $ sudo fmtutil-sys --refresh
