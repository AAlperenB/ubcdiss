Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Many questions are also answered in doc.pdf.

Q. I get an error in macros.tex that \DeclareUrlCommand can't be found.

A. Your TeX distribution has an old version of url.sty.  Find a more
   recent version, such as:
   
    http://ctan.org/get/macros/latex/contrib/misc/url.sty

   and just copy it to this directory.



Notes on using XeTeX/XeLaTeX:
=============================

Many TeX distributions ship with an older version of XeTeX/XeLaTeX,
and you may need to use a more recent version of XeTeX/XeLaTeX; I
used 0.997.  If you're not a somewhat proficient C hacker, then
find a capable friend.  The XeTeX source can be fetched from

    http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/xetex/TRUNK

Run the handy 'build-xetex' script there.  If all goes well, you'll
have new versions of xetex, xdvipdfmx, and xdv2pdf which you'll need
to install in the right place.  Note that you may need to regenerate
your formats for the new xetex binary; the easiest way seems to be:

  $ sudo fmtutil-sys --refresh
