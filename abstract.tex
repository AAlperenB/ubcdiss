\chapter{Abstract}

Put your abstract here.  It should be about 350 words or less.
The PhD programme and the online submission system caps the abstract
at 350 words.

Abstracts should generally try to avoid using acronyms.  If you
must, use the \verb+acronym+ package's \verb+\newacro+ to define
local versions here; these definitions will be overwritten by those
in \verb+glossary.tex+.

For example, the source for this page added the following definition:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newacro{ANOVA}{Analysis of Variance}
\end{verbatim}
\newacro{ANOVA}{Analysis of Variance}
so as to refer to \ac{ANOVA}.
