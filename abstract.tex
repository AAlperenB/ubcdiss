\newacro{UBC}{The University of British Columbia}
\newacro{FoGS}[FoGS]{Faculty of Graduate Studies}

At \ac{UBC}, both the \ac{FoGS} Ph.D. defence programme and the
Library's online submission system require that abstracts to be 350
words or less.

Abstracts should generally try to avoid using acronyms.  If you
must, use the \verb+acronym+ package's \verb+\newacro+ to define
local versions here; these definitions will be overwritten by those
in \filename{glossary.tex}.  See the \filename{glossary.tex} file for
examples of defining elements for a glossary.

For example, the source for this page added the following definition:
\begin{verbatim}
    \newacro{UBC}{The University of British Columbia}
    \newacro{FoGS}{Faculty of Graduate Studies}
\end{verbatim}
so as to refer to `\ac{UBC}' and `\ac{FoGS}'.
